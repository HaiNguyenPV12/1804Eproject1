                    I was seeking further knowledge in the field of maths so I decided to give it a shot and signed up.
                    Somewhere throughout the process, i felt confident enough to continue my college courses that I had paused.
                    Under the tutelage of professor Ward, I was able to gather enough insight in order to finish my degrees.
                    Now I do statistics involving manufacturing for Boeing and i Couldn’t be happier.

                    Halfway through my university journey, I was in a rough spot and entered quite a huge slump.
                    Luckily I was able to find this institute and found the help I needed.

                    My career actually started right here. I was doing some light accounting work for an internship and immediately
                    realized that I needed more insight. As I progressed and moved through the courses, my performance reflected that and before I knew it,
                    I had worked for the company for quite some time. As time passes, I figured that I should do something with my experience coupled with the
                    valuable knowledge I have gained from my studies here.
                    I’m looking forward to pass on my experiences to future generations.
